# agent-tutorial

found this amazing tutorial from this [tweet](https://x.com/adamwathan/status/1929601562772398109) (@adamwathan) and [blog](https://ampcode.com/how-to-build-an-agent)

I've changed the stack to use openai and nodejs, for my convenience.

I've also added some code which logs the requests made and the results from the model, other than that the concepts and results are exactly the same as in the blog post.
