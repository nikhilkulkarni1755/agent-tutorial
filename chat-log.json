You can fetch the most recent posts to use them.\n\n2. Create a basic HTML structure for a bio page. You can choose to display your posts in an organised way or in a grid layout, depending on your preference.\n\n3. Use JavaScript, specifically AJAX, to call the Twitter API and display the posts onto the Webpage. You might need to parse the JSON output of the API to display the data properly.\n\nRemember, you will have to install and setup a web server like Apache or Nginx to build and test this webpage locally.\n\nIf you need guidance or examples on how to do any of the above steps, I would be happy to help!\n",
