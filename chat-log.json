You can fetch the most recent posts to use them.\n\n2. Create a basic HTML structure for a bio page. You can choose to display your posts in an organised way or in a grid layout, depending on your preference.\n\n3. Use JavaScript, specifically AJAX, to call the Twitter API and display the posts onto the Webpage. You might need to parse the JSON output of the API to display the data properly.\n\nRemember, you will have to install and setup a web server like Apache or Nginx to build and test this webpage locally.\n\nIf you need guidance or examples on how to do any of the above steps, I would be happy to help!\n",

You would need to modify the `app.tsx` file manually. \n\nHere's a simple guide on how you can edit `app.tsx` to show some text:\n\n1. Open `app.tsx` in your code editor (VsCode, Atom, etc.).\n2. Find the component that displays the default Vite counter and remove it. In most cases, it is the `Counter` component or similar.\n3. Now, to display some text, you can write a simple hello world component in the same `app.tsx` file.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```tsx\nimport { h, FunctionalComponent } from 'vue';\n\nconst App: FunctionalComponent = () => {\n  return h('div', null, 'Hello World');\n};\n\nexport default App;\n```\n\nThis will create a simple functional component that returns a div with the text \"Hello World\". \n\nRemember to save `app.tsx` file after editing it, and make sure your Vite server is running to see the changes take effect.\n\nIf the 'Counter' component is in another file, you may need to navigate to that specific file and substitute it with your preferred text. \n\nIf you're unfamiliar with the Vite codebase or syntax, consider seeking help from a fellow developer or researching more about Vite.",

What you think you become.\" - Buddha.\n2. \"We are what our thoughts have made us; so take care about what you think. Words are secondary. Thoughts live; they travel far.\" - Swami Vivekananda.\n3. \"You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.\" - Marcus Aurelius.\n\nResources:\n1. \"The Happiness Advantage: How a Positive Brain Fuels Success in Work and Life\" by Shawn Achor. He proposes that our brains perform significantly better when they are positive than when they are negative, neutral, or stressed.\n2. \"The Power of Positive Thinking\" by Norman Vincent Peale. This book offers a smorgasbord of anecdotes and reassurances that positivist thinking is vital in order to live a fulfilling life.\n3. Research by Barbara Fredrickson, a psychologist at the University of North Carolina, suggests that positive emotions broaden our awareness and encourage novel, varied, and exploratory thoughts and actions.\n\nRemember, scientific research supports the idea that having a positive outlook can lead to better outcomes and healthier mental states. So, keep thinking positive!",
